# Interactive Fourier Series Visualization with Pygame

This project provides an interactive graphical interface using Pygame to visualize and experiment with Fourier series in two dimensions. By drawing a shape or outline with the mouse, the application decomposes the drawing into a series of rotating vectors that recreate the original shape, demonstrating how Fourier series can break down complex curves.

## Features

- **Freeform Drawing**: Click and trace points to create a custom shape or outline within the interface.
- **Fourier Series Decomposition**: Computes a series of rotating vectors to reproduce the drawn shape.
- **Moving Vector Visualization**: Displays each vector as a line with a circle and a triangle to indicate direction and magnitude.
- **Markers and Trace Lines**: Adds a trace of vector endpoints to show the trajectory of the shape over time.
- **Customizable Settings**: Enable or disable options such as markers, triangles, circles, and adjust the number of vectors to see their impact on the accuracy of shape reconstruction.
- **Grid and Background Image Options**: Option to display a grid as a visual reference and the ability to load a background image.
